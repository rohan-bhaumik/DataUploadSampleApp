## 🔧 Configuration

### API Configuration
The frontend connects to the backend API. Update the API base URL in each component:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';
```

For production, consider using environment variables:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
```

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration is in `tailwind.config.js`.

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Run development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run eject` - Eject from Create React App (⚠️ one-way operation)

### Hot Reload
The development server supports hot reload - changes to source files will automatically refresh the browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates optimized production build in the `build/` directory.
